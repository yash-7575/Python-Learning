#Problem 16 : Program to delete characters at indices divisible by 3

# Create a new string excluding characters at indices divisible by 3

for index in range(len(text)):
    if index % 3 != 0:  # Keep characters whose indices are not divisible by 3
        new_text += text[index]

# Output the modified string
